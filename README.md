# Medicine Side Effects Prediction - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Preprocessing
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Preprocessing for predicting the side effects of medicines based on various features. The goal is to prepare the dataset for predictive modeling by exploring the data, handling missing values, and performing necessary transformations to ensure the data is ready for machine learning algorithms.

# Data Preprocessing
The following preprocessing tasks were completed to prepare the dataset for modeling:

Handling Missing Data: Missing values were imputed or removed based on the importance of the feature.
Categorical Encoding: Converting categorical variables into numerical form using techniques like Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding.
Normalization/Standardization: Scaling numerical features to ensure uniformity across the dataset for future model training.
Outlier Detection: Identifying and handling outliers to improve the quality of the dataset.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features where necessary to capture more information from the existing dataset.
